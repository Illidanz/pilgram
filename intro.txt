Greetings stranger. Welcome to the grim & dark world of {wn}.

Test your strength and your gear by going on endless quests and become the ultimate adventurer.
Gain wealth ({mn}) and experience, join cults, meet friendly faces during your travels, acquire powerful gear & beautiful homes!

You can do all that & more in Pilgram, you just have to create a character with the `create character` command!

The first thing you should do is crafting something to defend yourself with at the smithy, use `check smithy` & `craft [number]` to craft the item you want.
To then equip your new item use the `equip 1` command (check inventory with the `inventory` command)

Then after that, use the `embark 1` command to begin your first quest!
Enjoy!

Use the `help` command to see all the commands you can use.

And thanks for playing :)
