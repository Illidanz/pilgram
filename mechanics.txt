Pilgram is an *idle adventure RPG with multiplayer elements* and it has quite a few mechanics.
Let's tackle them in sections:

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Players*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
that's you! Players are the most complex part of Pilgram in terms of stats, so here's a short recap:

üî∑ *Level*: Shows how experienced your character is, influences your success rate on quests (formula follows later).

üî∑ *Boromian Alloy*: The money of the world of Borom.

üî∑ *XP*: Reach a certain amount and your character will level up. Doing anything in the game grants you XP.
The amount of xp required to *level up* is calculated with the *formula*:
`XP = 100 x lv^2 + 1000 x lv`, where `lv` is your current level.

üî∑ *Gear level*: You current gear level, influences your success rate on quests.
Upgrading your gear costs money, the *upgrade cost* is calculated with the following *formula*:
`COST = 50 x lv^2 + 1000 x lv` where `lv` is the current level of your gear.

üî∑ *Home level*: You current home level, influences events rewards (formula follows later).
Upgrading your home costs money, the *upgrade cost* is calculated with the *formula*:
`COST = 100 x lv^2 + 5000 x lv` where `lv` is the current level of your home.

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Quests*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Your main source of income & xp. *Succeeding in a quest* depends on a D20 throw:

if you *roll 1* you *fail* the quest.
if you *roll 19* or more you *succeed* the quest.
For the *in between numbers*, the minimum value that your roll has to beat is calculated using the *formula*:

`MIN ROLL = 6 + zl - pl + (1.2 x zl - (gl + pl) / 2) x sqrt((4 / zl) x (qn - 1))`
where `zl` = zone level, `pl` = player level, `gl` = gear level, `qn` = quest number.

_Note: quest number is the amount of quests you did in the zone._
_Note: zone level is the minimum required level for the zone, NOT the zone number._

Once you fail a quest you can't retry it, but don't worry about it since there is literally an infinite amount of them.

The formula for quest rewards is a bit simpler:
`MULT = zl x qn + (guild level)
rand = rand(1 to 50)
XP REWARD = 950 x MULT + rand
MONEY REWARD = 760 x MULT + rand`

Quests also provide *prestige* for the guild you are currently in.
The amount of prestige a quest gives upon successful completion is determined by the *formula*:

`PRESTIGE = zone level + quest number`

Quest duration follows the formula:

`DURATION = 1 day + (1 hour x zone level) + (2 hours x quest number) + (3 hours x rand(0 to zone level))`

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Guilds*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Clubs for you and your friends! Or ways to "compete" with others.
Guilds can hold 4 players per level; The maximum level for guilds is 10 (so 40 players).
Creating a guild costs 1000, but upgrading it is extremely expensive:

`COST = 10000 x lv^2 + 1000 x lv` where `lv` = guild level

Guild prestige does nothing: the higher it is, the higher your guild will be on the ranking. That's it.

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Events*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
The random updates you are sent every once in a while.
You get events even while not on a quest, so you can still (really slowly) level up even by staying in town.
Both xp & money rewards follow the formula:

if the player's level is higher or equal to (zone level - 3):
`REWARD = (zl + 2 + hl) * rand(1 to 10)`
else
`EWARD = (2 + hl) * rand(1 to 10)`
where `zl` = zone level, `hl` = player home level.

Sometimes you can meet other players going through their own journey.
This gives you a lot of XP, following the formula:

`XP REWARD = 400 * zone id + 1`, so in zone 2 you'd get 1200 xp for meeting another player.

_Note: Town is considered zone 0 (level 0), so you only get 400 XP for town meetings._

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Minigames*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
You can play these to earn some more money & xp, plus they are fun!
We won't go into detail here, you can use the command `list minigames` to see which minigames are available.
Then use the command `explain minigame [minigame name]` to get more info about each minigame.
The use the command `play [minigame name]` to, well, play the minigame.

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Artifacts*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Exceedingly rare mysterious artifacts you can craft with 10 artifact pieces, each artifact increases your maximum eldritch power by 10 (starts from 0).
You can use your eldritch power to cast spells.
